   - Waste reduction percentage vs. targets
   - Carbon footprint tracking
   - Cost savings from waste reduction

2. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - **UN SDG**: Progress towards Goals 2.4 (Food Security) & 12.3 (Waste Reduction)
   - **KRWG**: Korean Responsible Waste Guidelines compliance
   - **GDPR**: Data protection compliance for customer information

3. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Waste trend analysis
   - Peak waste time identification
   - Seasonal pattern recognition
   - Cost projection models

### Phase 6: Compliance & Reporting
1. **Automated Compliance Tracking**
   - Real-time compliance score calculation
   - Automatic regulation adherence monitoring
   - Alert system for compliance violations
   - Action item generation for improvement

2. **Report Generation** (`/waste-watchdog?view=reports`)
